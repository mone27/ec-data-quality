Finalized the concept note https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iqiHi2bNjDVvQwK8yO9XgsXCUIoKL15l6IT9jRVRAFc/edit#

started working on importing data

### 22 Nov

started working on the variable selection

explored data availability -> there are periods with not data at all

idea: consider adding some additional variables to the model, like time of the day or season

note: there is a 1 year gap in 2019

thought: a lot of data has poor quality for the CO2

found outlier (-400 millions) in the CO2 data (probably need to remove in preprocessing)

what is the difference between CO2 and co2_mean>

### 23 Nov

There are two vars `WS` and `wind_speed` which are similar but different!
